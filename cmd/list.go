You can use this list to see all the passwords you have stored or
to list every password for a specific service.

Examples:
	# List all the passwords stored
	passwordmanager list

	# List all the passwords stored for the service 'github'
	passwordmanager list -s github

		// I know that extracting the method of list passwords by service
		// and use it in the list all would sounds like an option, but that could
		// cause performance issues because each call to ListPasswordsByService
		// opens a new transaction and iterates through the usernames for that service.
